# Greetings!

Here is the <a href="https://jcalfee.github.io/bip39-chooser.html">Online</a> version..

This tool can generate a secure random mnemonic phrase that you may then personally modify. Your personal word selections help you to ensure that the phrase truly is random. This page calculates the last word programmatically so you'll have a valid Bip39 phrase.

Although the initial phrase is very random and very strong, adjusting each word gives benefits:

* Generating the phrase here allows you to preform a mnemonic phrase restore on your chosen device or software prior to using.
* Choosing a mnemonic phrase yourself helps protect against a flawed or malicious random number generator.
