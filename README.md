# Greetings!

Here is the <a href="https://jcalfee.github.io/bip39-chooser.html">Online</a> version..

This tool can generate a secure random mnemonic phrase that you may then personally modify. Your personal word selections help you to ensure that the phrase truly is random. This page calculates the last word programmatically so you'll have a valid Bip39 phrase.

For security, you can go to the online page, save the page (Save Page As..), look over the code (View Page Source), and use it offline (open it from your own folder).

The initial phrase is generated from the browser's secure random generator, additionally adjusting each word gives benefits:

* Choosing a mnemonic phrase yourself helps protect against a flawed or malicious random number generator (but you should check this code)
* Quick access to new strong safe and easy to type mnemonic phrases
* Create or validate mnemonic phrases from cold-storage
